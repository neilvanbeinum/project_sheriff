This section of the site contains rougher notes about progress on the project.

They're unlikely to be of interest to a reader but act as a record for me.

* 16/12 - session at Vietclimb.. power down quickly.. arms over head seems to get hard fast.. is POTS too much of a barrier above a certain level for me? Other factors: weight, finger and arm strength. Need to make the most of what I have / can do.
* 13/12 - session at Stone Goat - not feeling strong, powering down quickly? Bit achy. Questioning how realistic the goal is... EDIT: last go on big red hold overhang - completed! Nothing left in tank. 
* 12/12 - 25 min run, hot! 
* 10/12 - felt pretty much recovered from last session so had pm session at stone goat after sitting in a conference hall all day. 3 blue problems done but 2 blues seemed impossible. One was pockets at 45 deg and another had an impossible slopey pocket to hang off. Kind of reminder of core strength importance. 3x 1 min planks! Might need to up the training on that. Long rest and chat with another climber. 
* 9/12 - at a conference for work. Massive lunch buffet available. Salad!
* 8/12 - after overnight train so poor sleep. Session at Stonegoat Bangkok. It’s sweaty in here! Easy session post covid - want to take things slow. Realised I get a bit nervy higher up: can I train for this? Managed 2 (or 3?) of the blue problems. Noticed someone doing a very thorough yoga warmup.. maybe I should do that.
* 6/12 back to normal I think. Walking around. Will do some core stuff later. Almost tempted to go to wall but I want to save myself for the place in Bangkok in 2 days. Recovery seems to take 5 days, if meaning no forearm arches. Maybe gym later?? Just cycle or something. Dreamt about climbing - boreal stingers on feet, good footwork! 3 x 1 min planks.
* Mon 5/12 on the mend. Hour or so walk around town. Stronger.
* Tues 29/11 - Mon 5/12 SETBACK - COVID
* Mon 28/11 - generally eating slightly less than normal in the hope of losing a bit of weight. Possible run tonight or tomorrow alternatively. Can look up core strength exercises - do them in the hotel.
* Sun 27/11 - Alpine Outpost, CM, 2xV4, overhanging slopey, crimpy vertical. Fingers feel the limitation - power down! Undercut problem - Core strength. Post climbing training:
  * Planks 60s, 60s, 60s
  * Deadhang incut edge 7s, 10s, 10s (thought was dead before this: maybe I don’t power down as much as I think? Or base level stays?)
  * Rings pull-ups (palms facing) 5, 5, 5
* Sun 20/11 - Alpine Outpost, CM, V4 max, juggy
