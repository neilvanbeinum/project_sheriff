Visited early December, 2022.

A large bouldering wall a couple of bus stops away from the centre of the old town.

The wall entrance is set back from the road, beyond a motorbike garage.

They have a Moonboard and a similar system from another manufacturer - I think it's called a Kilter board.

I paid about 250,000 Dong for the day pass, including shoes and chalk.

The guy behind the desk seemed a bit bored and uninterested.

The problems seemed well-set, with a lot of variety.
