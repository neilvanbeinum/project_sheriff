What could stop me from completing the project?

<h2>Health condition</h2>

Perhaps the most important factor is a health condition I experience called Postural Tachycardia Syndrome which annoyingly means I have a few different symptoms to battle to climb hard.

More information in the [health condition post](/pots).

<h2>Age and Energy</h2>

I have to acknowledge my body is different to when I was a teenager. I need to be a bit careful with landings and recovery time. I won’t get as strong as quick as when I was younger, and keeping a low weight might be a bit more of a challenge (although I seem to have good genetics for this as I haven’t changed weight much.)

I also work full time and generally have less energy than before.
