Visited Saturday 7 Jan, 2023.

This small wall is 20 minutes by taxi from the old centre. Inside the old warehouse is a mix of roped climbing, bouldering and Ninja Warrior-style obstacle courses.

The bouldering is over two floors.

This wall uses V grades rather than its own system.

It cost 220K Dong for a session including shoe hire and chalk.

I liked the friendly atmosphere here, with people pushing each other on.

There's a Moonboard upstairs.
