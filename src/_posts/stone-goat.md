Visited Thursday 8 December, 2022.

This wall is 5 minutes walk from a subway station in central Bangkok.

I paid for a one-off deal of 750 Baht for 3 sessions which includes shoe and chalk bag rental.

It's a huge centre. I visited midday and although there's several fans (including the biggest ceiling fans I've seen) it was too hot to be  comfortable. Ideally there would be A/C inside.

Tired from poor sleep on an overnight train, I didn't expect to climb too hard but I actually got some relatively hard problems done. The wall has a relative grading system and a massive selection of problems. [Alpine Outpost]("/../alpine-outpost") in Chiang Mai had a friendlier atmosphere, perhaps because it's smaller.
