There's a number of differences between climbing now and when I started. This post outlines some of the advantages I have now. Also see the [challenges post](/challenges).

<h2>Tech progress</h2>

I started climbing before the web was widespread which obviously dates me! By the time I’d started to wind-down from climbing there were occasional low resolution videos online and a few websites and forums like [UKClimbing](https://www.ukclimbing.com/) and [UKBouldering](https://ukbouldering.com), both still going strong.

Now there’s of course a world of content available for climbers online. You could watch YouTube climbing videos with high-end production values for days on end now for inspiration. Guidebooks are available as apps, and locating yourself using GPS is straightforward, so finding problems outdoors is easier too.

I don’t know how far advancements have moved for bouldering gear. But I’m sure design of equipment like shoes and mats have moved on too.

<h2>Walls</h2>

There are way more climbing walls as climbing has exploded in popularity. It’s now in the Olympics! I shouldn’t have trouble finding at least one wall in most cities.

<h2>Advancement of Training Techniques</h2>

Knowledge of what training techniques work best for climbing seem to have moved on. I'm never going to be working at a high level, but perhaps I'll be able to take something from new approaches that the pros use.
